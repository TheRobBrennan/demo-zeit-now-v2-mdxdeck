# Welcome
This project is intended to serve as a lightweight example for creating a [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) - a freely available tool that allows you to build presentations using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.htmlreac), and [React](https://reactjs.org) components - presentation that can be deployed to [Zeit Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/now).

You can view a [live demo]() at [https://demo-mdxdeck-nowv2.now.sh](https://demo-mdxdeck-nowv2.now.sh)

This demo has been based off the original tutorial created by Zeit at [https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/mdx-deck](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/mdx-deck)

## Cheat sheet
```
// Step 1 - Verify your presentation is up and running
$ npm start

// Step 2 - Create `now.json` for deployment to Zeit Now v2

// Step 3 - Deploy to now
$ npm run deploy

```

## Next steps
This is a great starting point for working with a [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) presentation that does not incoporate any custom components, themes, etc. A great future enhancement would be to demonstrate how to include custom components and content.
